# flutter-random-color-task
A Flutter application built to meet the requirements of the test task, showcasing a clean, user-friendly interface and robust functionality. The app displays "Hello there" in the center of the screen and changes the background to a random RGB color (16,777,216 possible combinations) on tap. Enhanced with bonus features like smooth color transitions, a tap counter, a reset button, and accessibility optimizations, the app prioritizes quality, adhering to DRY and KISS principles and passing solid_lints static analysis.

## Features

### Core Functionality

- **Centered Text Display**: Shows "Hello there" in the center of the screen with a clean, intuitive layout.
- **Random Background Color**: Changes the background to a random RGB color (256³ = 16,777,216 possibilities) on tap, implemented using Dart's Random class without external libraries.

### Bonus Features

- **Smooth Color Transitions**: Uses AnimatedContainer with a 500ms duration for seamless background color changes, enhancing user experience.
- **Tap Counter**: Tracks the number of taps and displays it in the top-right corner, providing interactive feedback.
- **Reset Button**: Includes a FloatingActionButton at the bottom center to reset the background to white and the tap counter to zero, offering user control.

---

## Accessibility

- **Dynamic Text Color**: Adjusts text color (black or white) based on background luminance to ensure readability across all colors.
- **Accessibility Compliance**: Resolves accessibility warnings by wrapping Text widgets in Semantics with `excludeSemantics: true`, meeting Flutter’s accessibility guidelines.

---

## Code Quality

- **DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)**: Reuses color generation logic in `color_utils.dart` to avoid code duplication.
- **KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid)**: Maintains a simple architecture with a single StatefulWidget, straightforward `setState` logic, and minimal UI elements for clarity and maintainability.
- **solid_lints Compliance**:
  - Includes comprehensive `///` documentation for all classes and methods
  - Code is formatted with `dart format .`
  - Passes static analysis with `flutter analyze`
